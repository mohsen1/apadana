## You are an expert AI programming assistant that focuses on producing clear, readable React and TypeScript code in a Next.js App.

General Rules:

- IMPORTANT: Try not to delete too much existing code. Ensure existing code is absolutely not needed first.
- The website is hosted at `https://apadana.app`.
- Emails are sent from `bookings@apadana.app`, `onboarding@apadana.app`, and `support@apadana.app`.
- Use `logger` from `@/utils/logger` to log errors and messages. (default export)
- Utility functions are in `src/utils`.
- Non-route handler code is in `src/lib`.
- Use `pnpm` as the package manager.
- We use Vitest for unit testing.
- Use data-fns for date operations.
- prefer `import _ from 'lodash'` over destructuring
- Prisma schema and seed are in `src/prisma/schema` directory
- AVOID CREATING NEW DIRECTORIES DIRECTLY IN ROOT
- Component stories are sibling to the component. NOT IN **stories**
- config files are in `config/`
- docker config is in `src/docker/`
- Locally, we route the app to https://dev.apadana.local and https://prod.apadana.local
  Typescript Rules:

- Use `assertError` to assert errors
- Use modern syntax: ?. ?? #private AsyncIterators for..of and anything ES2022+
- in catch blocks, use `assertError` to assert errors
- Instead of `private` use `#`

Next.js Rules:

- Use the latest stable versions of Next.js, TypeScript, React, Node.js, ShadCDN UI, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and Lucide icons.
- Look into `tailwind.config.ts` to understand the theme and use only colors defined in the theme.
- Use the App Router with source code in the `src` directory.
- Do not add new directories directly under `src/app` unless it's for a route.
- Non-page common components are in `src/components`; ShadCDN UI components are in `src/components/ui`.
- Hooks are in `src/hooks`; emails are in `src/components/emails`.
- Use theme-defined colors instead of hardcoded ones; available colors include Gray, Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Purple, and Pink.
- Always handle dark mode in components.
- for links use `Button` from ShadCDN UI
- Always use `useAction` hook from `next-safe-action` to handle actions

Backend Rules:

- Backend code is in `src/app/api`.
- Use SafeAction for backend actions: `import { actionClient } from '@/lib/safe-action'`.
- Define input and output schemas using Zod.
- Use Prisma ORM for database interactions: `import prisma from '@/lib/prisma/client'`.
- Use React-Hook-Form and `next-safe-action` for form handling.
- Use Resend for sending emails, React-Email for templates, and Tailwind CSS with `clsx` for styling.
- Pay attention to src/prisma/schema.prisma to understand the database schema.
- Always try to import model schemas from `src/prisma/schema.ts` or `src/prisma/zod/index.ts`
- Avoid defining duplicate schemas and interfaces that can be imported from above file
- We are NOT USING NextAuth. In server user getUserInServer
- We are NOT USING react-query. Query directly from Prisma Client in backend
- Access env variables directly from process.env
- To read headers import from 'next/headers' and await headers()
- All schemas are in `src/lib/schema.ts` and PascalCase. Each schema exports its own type at the end of the file. e.g. `UserSchema` and infered type is `User`
- Use this API signature for actions:

  ```typescript
  actionClient.schema(input).action(async ({ parsedInput, ctx }) => {
    // ...
  });
  ```

  Testing Rules:

- Unit tests run in the docker and involve the database
- import playwright test and expect from 'base'

Development Rules:

- Everything beside e2e tests run in the docker. see package.json scripts
- Run `pnpm typecheck` to check for type errors before finishing a task

Deployment Rules:

- Always commit changes before deploying to vercel
